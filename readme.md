A WIP NetworkTables library for JavaScript.

## Goals

- Provide a NetworkTables 4 client
- Allow total typesafety of messages & channels, if configured
  - This should be entirely opt-in
- Support Node.js and the browser with minimum setup
  - I suppose Deno support would be nice but I'm not going to spend any time to support it
